   - Custom validation rules configuration

5. TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT:
   - Atomic operations for data consistency
   - Rollback capability for failed imports
   - Partial import handling with detailed error reporting
   - Deadlock prevention for concurrent operations
   - Database connection pooling for performance

6. BACKGROUND PROCESSING:
   - Queue-based import processing for large datasets
   - Progress tracking and status updates
   - Email notifications for import completion/failure
   - Retry logic for failed records
   - Resource management and timeout handling

7. SECURITY AND PERMISSIONS:
   - Role-based access control for bulk import feature
   - File upload security (virus scanning, file type validation)
   - API rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Audit trail for all import operations
   - Data privacy compliance (GDPR/local regulations)

8. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
   - Batch insert operations for database efficiency
   - Caching strategies for repeated operations
   - Database query optimization
   - Memory usage optimization for large files
   - Concurrent processing capabilities
